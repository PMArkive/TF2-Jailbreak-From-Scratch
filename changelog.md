### v1.1
- Added LastRequest ConVar, which can be used to disable the LastRequest system entirely
- Added ConVars for Warden commands, so that they can be disabled. If disabled, a command will not show up in the warden menu. This will not disable the admin command equivalent.
- More work developing the timeout plugin
